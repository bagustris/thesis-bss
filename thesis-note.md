Dear Sensei,

I Uploaded my new sound files including surrounding noise here ( I think I made some mistakes on previuosly uploade file)

https://www.hicc.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/uploads/private/111029154555/new_result_bta.tar.gz

I add surrounding noise to two channels. The target vs surrounding noise is 30 dB.

I found in my result that delay occurs between estimated signal and original signal I posted in azukaruze link below,

https://www.hicc.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/uploads/private/111029151109/ori-est-pdcw.eps

So, I can not used SDR and friends for objective evaluation because they required the same length between original and estimated signal. I have tried to use segmental SNR which the code available in our library (Calc_SegSNR.m) by comparing estimated signal and original true signal. But it also require the same length. I can make it same but cut the length of signal, but is it objective? Only the output of FastICA has the same length with the original source

Regarding to those issue I postponed to send you my revision. But, I will keep working tonight to finish my paper. All is almost done except the objective evaluation.

Looking forward for your advice and suggestion.

Mr. Bagus,
please access the following file and please
make a proof read after revision.

Other comments;
1) Figures, Tables and references should be in order.
2) Figures and Tables should be on the page or the next
    of the referred sentence.
3) Simulation condition is un-realistic. You need to understand
   it more clearly.
4) Evaluation indexes are not proper to provide information on
   performance. You need to think about the proper why to evaluate.
5) Please upload the audible WAV files for
     the original target, the observed signal, and the enhanced target.
    
---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

I had listened the sound files in
  new_result_bta.tar.gz

Observed signal, especially for hrtf based simulation and
observed signal by dummy head, should be save as WAV file of
stereophonic so that human being to identify the target, interference
as well as surrounding noise in binaural hearing condition.

About enhanced signal:

output_fastica_exp as well as fastica_sim:
  there are points to exceed the maximum and those produce the
  many noise.  You need to make clear the maximum of enhanced
  signal in floating point is within the range of 16bit PCM.
  If the enhanced signal is within the 16bit PCM, the algorithm
  should be checked.

output_icabm_exp:
    there are two channels but only one channel has signal with very
   small level.  And the sound quality is very bad and long low frequency
   component is remained.

output_pdcw_exp:
    noise in mid frequency range is reduced and quality is best for all
    three output_*_exp.wav.

When you make signals, please listen by yourself first.
And please compare the listening impression with various indexes which
you calculate.

Yours,  
tuie

Dear Mr. Bagus,

there is "one" interference noise sound which is observed
at two microphone with different amplitude for your case.
I suggest to add independent noise for each channel in order
to take into account noise due to equipments and quantization
noise.
So,  s(t) = target, i(t) = interference, n_r(t) = independent noise for r channel,
n_l(t) = idependent noise for l channel.

Observer signals at two microphones are  
 y_r(t) = h_t_r(t) * s(t)  + h_i_r(t) * i(n) + n_r(t)  
 y_l(t) = h_t_l(t) * s(t)  + h_i_l(t) * i(n) + n_l(t)  
where  
  h_t_r(t) and h_t_l(t) stand for impulse responses from
target source to left and right channel. (Please consider the delay as well.)  
 and  
h_i_r(t) and h_i_l(t) stand for ones from interfere to left and right channel.

 and
 asterisk is the convolution in time domain.

Yours,  
tuie

---  
Dear Sensei,

Thank you very much for your reply.

I add two noises to two channel after convolved the sources signal with hrtf (hrtf_mic_r_withsurnoise.wav  in the files I sent).
It looks similar with your explanation.

How about the objective evaluation? Because the output files are different
length, I found difficulty to compare two signal except perceptually by
listening the sound and see the plot in details. 

---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

about the way of writing, please refer the previous PDF which I have
commented on.
Note that the word "we" in the document mean readers (as well as authors);
not authors.

Other comments are ;
0) About the authors' names, please write full-spell instead of initials.

1) Title of chapter 2 "Theory" is not proper because those methods are
   proposed a priori  and  your paper's position is "to compare those."

2) Current pragraph between "2. Theory" and "2.1 Binaural Model"
  should be written in Introduction because you need to mention why
  you need to compare those conventional methods.

3) Order of figures and position of figures are out of order and not
   proper.
   If you are using Latex, not write figure number directly and use
   the reference to get figure number.
  (Figure 3 appeared in left column in p.2, but there are not Figure 1 nor
   2 before that. Figure 1 & 2 are referred in p.3. And Figure 3 is in p.4.)

4) Many terms in equations are not clearly defined.
    Eq.(1)  x_L[n], x_R[n], \delta[n]  are not the mentioned.

5) The parameter d(k, m) in p.2 is not the used so any other place.
    Necessity of expression is not clear nor k and m are not mentioned
   at all.

6) Expression in Equations are not inconsistent.
    In 2.1, sampled signals are used such that x[n].
    In 2.2, continuous signals are used such that x(t).
    S(f) is defined as frequency domain expression of s(t),
    but you omit f in Eq.(5) and surrounding sentences.
  Rewrite whole algorithm in sampled signal expression.

7) Definition of norm used in Eq.(7) is not given.

8) Eq.(8) need =.

9) Put the signal labelling such as s[n], i[n], and x_L[n] in Figure 3
   as well as for the distance assumed or used.
   If 45 degree means the azimuth, you can not write at the source
   position, but write as the angular expression

  ```
      \    |
       \ 45|
        \  |
         \ |
          \|
  ```

  Define the coordinate.

10) About the color,  there are not special reason to use the color
   in Fig.1, Fig.2 and Fig.3. Remove the color attribute if it is
   not really necessary.

11) In results,
   You need to put the subsection as 4.1 Simulation  and 4.2 Experiment.
   And it is not clear whether it shows the results for simulation or
   experiment. You need to mentioned in sentence as well as capture.

   Necessary figures are such that
    Figure 5   Results of Simulation;  Target signal, Observed signal at
         left, Observed signal at right, Enhanced signal by PDCW,
         Enhanced signal by <all other methods>

   Figure 6   Results of Experiment:  <Same as above.>
   Figure caption /labels should be BELOW the figure.
    (Don't write "Observed signal" above the waveform plot.)
    Labels in the each of plot are too small. Please the
    font size no smaller than 80% of font size of sentence.

12) In Table 1. results of simulation should be remove.
    For the simulation, additive noise is very principle condition.
   About the values,  please let me know how you measure the
        SNR
   for enhanced signal?  (Please define as Equation.)

13) Again, there are several syntax errors, so please check when you
   draft;   correspondence between subject and verb,

14) Paper titles in the references should be written within double
  quote and remove the double attribute.

**I am sorry, but it is not yet finishing stage yet.**

---  
Dear Sensei,

Thanks a lot for your review, I will revise it again.
Here my code for calculating SNR, I use variance to measure power.

```
Signal=enhanced_signal;
noise=original_noise_16k;

%Calculating Signal and noise power from their variance
signalPower = var(Signal);
noisePower = var(noise);

%Calculate Signal to noise ratio for the Signal and Noise
SNRratio = signalPower/noisePower;
measuredSNR=10*log10(SNRratio)
```
---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

var(x) is defined  
>   var (x) = sum(power(x-mean(x), 2))/(length(x)-1)

this is what you means for
> SNRratio = signalPower/noisePower;

Definition of SNRratio should be  
>   SNRratio = sumsq(signal) / sumsq(noise)

2. before that. Figure 1&  2 are referred in p.3. And Figure 3 is in p.4.)

Please check it.

Yours,  
tuie

---   
Dear Mr. Bagus,

thank you for your revision. I have confirm your revision
and it is much clear to discuss.

> 3) I tried to order the figure, I use \ref{labelname} from the beginning, but I don't know why it
got error, I fix it manually.
Would you let me know the eror that you get, or
make a test source file with same style file in order to check the referencing.

About the results,
1) noise level is very different between observed signals in
  Fig.5 and Fig.6.

2) there are time shift, especially one violate the causality, between the
  observed and enhanced signals of PDCW both for Fig.5 and Fig.6.

About documents, I will try to reply until tomorrow noon, but I may
reply tomorrow night.

---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

First of all, keep the CC hicc-all to share the situation across the
lab.


About the figure, just send the source around figure.
(It seems that you reference is looking for section not figure.)

for example, you can refer as the figure
```
\begin{figure}[b]
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./figs/mic_head_set2.eps}
  \caption{Canal ...}
  \label{fig:HAprot}   %<<<=== this is the label
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
```
by
> microphone and earphone shown in Fig.\ref{fig:HAprot}.

1) If you set fix the amplitude of the source position and the
  set the signal level at the source position, it should be the
  same both for simulation and experiment.

  How did you set the signal level at source position for
  target and noise?


2) If the original code has an time lag, you need to compensate to it
  otherwise you are not able to compare with other algorithims.
  The time lag should be estimated by reading source or by simulation for various
  source such that impulse.

---  
Mr. Bagus,

beside the comments which I have sent last night,
I would like to ask you one more thing.

3) The vertical axis of Fig.6 (b)(c) are 1.05 not 1.0, thus
the scale is not the same to others. Please check the scale
of the signal because Fig.6(b)(c) should be the recorded signals
thus they can not be more than 1.0.
(Also the scale should be the same for comparison.)

Yours, 
tuie

---  
Dear Sensei,

1). So I understand why the observed signal between simulation and experiment are very different. I didn't set up the level signal yet.
How to set up the source level signal? Can I set up manually? for example, like my previous methodt: x_l(t)=0.6*s(t) and so on.

2). I checked the time lag for pdcw, and it has the constant time lag for the the same signal length
So, I can cut all signal and make the length same to the output of pdcw algorithm and compare it

Thank you for your help about latex and looking forward for your advice.

---  
Dear Sensei,

In Fig 6(b)(c) actually the level is not 1.05, but 0.05. (I don't know
why the figure is cut by latex, I also include ylabel('amplitude'), but
it also not shown).

I have set the maximum level (both itunes and audio pc) when record but the recorded signal has
small intensity level. I also got this result when I do my experiment in
Indonesia, the max amplitude only 0.002 using condenser mic with TRS
connection. It depends on distance and mic characteristics. The better
result was achieved using XLR connection microphone.

About the output of pdcw, I have tested with some inputs and the time lag is constant.
So, I can cut other outputs length to be the same with output of pdcw and
compared to others

And how to set source signal levels when convolving with hrtf?

---  
Dear　Mr. Bagus,


 > I have set the maximum level (both itunes and audio pc) when record but the recorded signal has
 > small intensity level. I also got this result when I do my experiment in

please specify the block diagram for experiments
with equipments specification.

The volume control of PC is not sufficient if your selection of
microphone is not proper.

For example, your microphone's maker and product
code with produce specification.

---  
Dear Mr. Vecky and Mr. Bagus,
in order to finish the ASJ-kyushu documnets, please stand
by at 12F on 16:30 tomorrow afternoon.
(This is the last chance to talk directly to you before the deadline,
 because I will be Tokyo on Nov. 4th.)

Yours,  
tuie @ Sendai, Japan

---  
Dear Sensei,

I did what you sugested last night to compute residual signal as noise with the following formula,

> residu=s_hat-s			where s_hat and s are in the best fit

But, from the waveform we can get the information that the power of true target signal is bigger than enhanced signal or s_har has the smaller power than s.
In the case of the formula above, residu can be said as error.

> residu=s_hat-s	residu=error (of measurement)

So, as alternative, I use MSE (mean square error) to compute error between true signal and enhanced signal.
> mse=1/n*(sum(error.^2)) 		n=length of signal

I make two version of my paper, one used SNR and another used MSE. 
For MSE-based evaluation is here,

https://www.hicc.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/uploads/private/111104102226/asj_kyushu_meeting_template_mse.pdf


And for SNR-based evaluation is here,
https://www.hicc.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/uploads/private/111104103721/asj_kyushu_meeting_template.pdf


Thank you very much for your advices, and please let me know if I can send one of those paper.

---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

did you compensate the gain and latency?
If you did not,
> residu=s_hat-s                        where s_hat and s are in the best fit
never works.

The given score given in
> https://www.hicc.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/uploads/private/111104102226/asj_kyushu_meeting_template_mse.pdf
are very strange.

Please make
  s(n)
and
  s_enhanced(n)
has the same peak level and the delay between s(n) and s_enhanced(n) can
be obtained by cross-correlation.

MSE is also the same issue if you use
  untreated  ERROR = s(n) - s_enhance(n)

Please be hurry to revise it.

Yours,
tuie

Dear Mr. Bagus,  
CC: Mr. Saho,


both mse and snr you have send are not able to use.
I will start to move to Waseda Univ. thus I would be out of

Looking foward to having your revised information.

Yours,

Dear Mr. Bagus,

> and I got error syntax error: number of rows must match

take length(signal)
and  length(enhanced_signal)

and the make them the same.

This kind of thing can be solve by labo members, so do not waste
the time.
I am sorry that I can to keep in touch the network because of limit
power of PC.
I will contact to once every hour around X:00-X:10.

If you hear the ERROR (s(n)-s_enhanced(n), you will get
  echo if the lag is not properly calibrated,
  strong signal if the level is not compensated well.
Please check it first.

Yours,  
tuie

PS Don't remove cc to hicc-all to share the information, especially such
  a kind of situation;  need to make a very soon, and some thing like
  "error message" of programing language. 

---  
Dear Sensei,

Yes, the length of signal is same.
Mr Saho and me computed the time lag between signal from various its peak, the snr still strange;
for fastica, snr(dB)=   -0.871;       enhanced vs residu
We also adjusted the level to have the same peak.

Looking forward for your advice.

---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

the information you have provided is not enough.

Did you hear the residual?
Please send the information about
 the length of data for target, observed, three enhanced.
also
 the mag. of normalized signals (T, O, 3 E)
and
 the time lag to compensate latency for O and 3E.

Yours,
tuie

Dear Sensei,

Thank you for your reply,

Yes, I hear the residual, it similar to the target signal
Firstly the length of target, observed left right, result_fastica and resullt_icabm are 80000 samples
for result_pdcw is 77599, then I make all have the same length i.e 75198 (for simulation)

	 min		-1			-8.217		-0.8263		-0.78693		-0.5526			-0.9291


Time lag to compensate:  
result_fastica = 257 samples  
result_pdcw=1179 samples  
result_icabm= 16 samples

Dear Bagus,

I got your sound files.
There is no explanation about the files.
There is a file named "datacutexp" and "dataexp" but there is no extension.

Please inform send the file information in PLAIN TEXT or

I need to board now and I will go back to my home tonight.
I will come to 12th floor on 15:00 tomorrow thus please be stand by.

Dear Bagus,

I could not find out the sound files after normalization.
Please send the sound files after normalization and time lag compensation;
in other word, sound files used for subtraction to obtain error signal.

Dear Mr. Bagus,

I found out the data in *.mat for octave.
And I have tried to compensate the linear filter, but
the phase information are completely destroyed for the
enhanced signals and the temporal characteristics of phase
are not the stable.

Tomorrow, not tonight, please install PRAAT to get the spectrogram.
One of the solution to express the performance of processing
would be an spectrogram.

Also I will check the change of coherences between target and
observed, as well as target and enhanced.

Yours,
tuie 

---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

I calculate the coherence:

1)
```
coh_ob   = coherence(signal, obs_mic_l_16k, 512);
coh_fica = coherence(signal, result_fastica, 512);
coh_icabm= coherence(signal, result_icabm, 512);
coh_pdcw = coherence(signal, result_pdcw,  512);
```

please plot them such that
> plot(coh_fica(1:256), "", coh_ob(1:256));

As far as I see, the performance of all of three methods
are not so high for the condition you have check.

2) The averaged coherence over frequency can be an index;
```
coh_ob:
sqrt( (coh_ob'*coh_ob)/length(coh_ob)
0.22893

coh_fica
0.35149

coh_icabm
0.27710

coh_pdcw
0.28305
```
Those indexes provide the order as
 coh_ob<    och_icbm<    coh_pdcw<    coh_fica

Yours,
tuie

Dear Sensei,

I have tried to calculate the coherence and got the following error,

the ITD as described in [1]. The binaural
model refers to phase difference channel
wighting (PDCW) and it can be shortly
explained as follows. The two microphones
recorded sound from the target speaker and
interfering white noise. The first process
is STFT which decomposes two sound signals
in frequency and time, then ITD is estimated
through comparison of two signals
at each frequency. The time-frequency (t-f)
mask identifying the ITDs which was close
to the target speaker’s ITD is identified. The
gammatone channel weighting works on that
subset and the resynthesizes process was obtained
using inverse STFT and overlap-add
method."

"Mathematically, the two sound signals
reaching microphones can be formulated below,
  (1)
with xl and xr represent signal from left and
right microphone from dummy head and !(l)
is ITD from sources. Using STFT can be
obtained the Fourier of those signals. Correspondingly,
the parameter ! in the Eq.(1)
can be replaced with the frequency dependent
ITD parameter d(k,m), where k is frequency
index and m is the frame index. Furthermore,
details explanation of PDCW algorithm
can be found in [1]. By assuming a
specific time-frequency bin is dominated by
single source, it can be decided using binary
decision whether the time-frequency bin belongs
to target speaker or not."

"Although the details explanation of PDCW algorithm
can be found in [1], key of this method is
how to identify the specific time-frequency bin

PDCW makes the binary decision whether the time-frequency

ITD for each time-frequency bins.

weighting is applied, the resynthesis pro- cess is performed by means of
inverse STFT and overlap-add method.

"Actually, both binaural model and ICA
in third method use time-frequency mask.
The masks applies a weight to each T-F
unit so that spatial-temporal that are dominated
by target speaker are enhanced and
others are suppressed. Perceptually, this
idea is motivated by human auditory phenomenon
in which a sound is rendered by
louder sound within critical band [3]. One
of time-frequency masks is the ideal binary
mask proposed byWang et.al. They denoted
the target signal as s(t, f) and the interference
noise is n(t, f). Then the ideal binary
masks is defined as
 m(t, f) =  Eq.(6)
where t and f are index of time and frequency.
Parameter " is choosen to be 0 corresponding
to 0 dB criterion [3].

ICA with binary time-frequency masking

"   Like the binaural model described in section 2.2,
the ICA with time-frequency masking is proposed

in time-frequency domain is expressed as
               1    if  S_1(n,k)-S_2(n,k) > \theta
   M(n,k) =
               0    otherwise
where $n$ and $k$ stand for indexes of time and frequency,
and $S_1(n,k)$ and $S_2(n,k)$ stand for spectral components
for the target and interference signals.
Because $M(n,k)$ has binary weights, this method can be called
as ICA with binary masking. The threshold $\theta$ is set
to 0 corresponding 0dB."

The data from computational simulation are

noise also was added to each channel

target sound comes from 0o and the interfering
noise is emitted from －45o. The dotted

head and target signal is 1 m.
The recording process from experiment
can be shown in Fig. 3. The experiment
was conducted using dummy head or head
and torso simulator to record the mixed tar-
get and noise sounds in anechoic room. The
data were directly obtained as two wav files
to be inputed to the algorithms. The wav
files are sampled 44100 Hz, 16 bits PCM.

"4 Result
The results for both simulation and experiment
data was presented mainly in comparison
of coherence. Three data from simulation,
simulation with surrounding noise
and experiment were used in three different
methods. In the PDCW method, the
changes of the ITD threshold from 0.2 to
0.3; 0.4; 0.5; 0.6 and 1.0 make improvement
based on listened enhanced sound and waveform
of signal. Perceptually, noise in mid
frequency range is reduced by PDCW and
the quality is between FastICA and ICABM.
In the second method, FastICA algorithm
which previously used in instantaneous mixture
was applied directly to real convolutive
mixture. In this method, there are points
to exceed the maximum and those produce
the many noise in output signal. However,
result of FastICA algorithm for experiment
are best based on coherence criterion. Finally,
ICA with binary masks is applied to
the data to provide fair comparison using
coherence criterion. We can see in Fig. 3
in which the waveform of ICA with binary
mask as adopted from [4] is similar to target
but it has low coherence. The result of
ICABM can minimize interfering noise and
remains target signal, but the sound quality
is degraded as can be seen by its spectrogram
in Fig. 4. That figure shows the comparison
of spectrogram signals from experiment
data while Table 1 shows the different
coherence among three methods."

Dear Mr. Bagus,

the contents of the sent poster is basically fine.

However you need to think about the poster venue's situation.
If the venue is crowded and you can not look a lower part of

reading the lower part of poster?

If you can not understand this comments, please contact M2 students
who had poster presentation before hand.

Dear Mr. Bagus,

please send the email to HICC-ALL.
you are one of the authers as well as I am.
You need to share all the activities with co-authers at least
in the lab.

1)
What is ICABM in results and conclusion?
Where you have defined?

2)
Labels of spectrograms and waveforms are visible?

3)
What is input SNR for simulation and experiment?
(You need to show those experimental condition in the poster
  otherwise the data are meaningless because we can not
  compare the values of simulation and experiment.)

4)
In the figure of experimental setup, the origin of source angle
should be the center of head, not nose position.
And please note that 1.0m from the HATS to loudspeakers is
in the near field condition as the HRTF. That means
the condition can not be simulated using ordinary HRTF database
such as MIT media labo's, Nagoya University's one and others.
(You need to know this mis-match between simulation and experiment.)

5)
Why your file is more than 30Mbyte?
(From Indonesia, I will not able to access this kind of file size.
  Waveforms should be rasterized before including the poster.)

    ICABM is ICA with binary mask
without any information.

If the input SNR is 18dB, you need to write this information in your poster.

Why you don't make a simulation results for SNR=18dB and add the information on this
poster?

You can make it because there are 4 days for presentation.

because the quality of enlarge image is not good enough to read.

The revised poster is fine with what I have mentioned except the
position of conclusion.
However, you can print as this format if you think it is OK.

Beside this poster, I am little bit confusing that
   ICABM's BM seems to be abbreviation of "Binary Masking" in the
poster, but your research plan, you use "Binaural Masking."
Which is what you have used and what you will use?

Anyway, the poster seems to ready to print. Have a nice trip

I can't say at this time, but I assumed it will work. The output FastICA remains noise, by using binaural mask, I hope it can be obtained enhanced signal that good in both numerical criterion and perceptually listened sound.

Actually I need your advices to design my experiment. As first, I propose combinations of experimental conditions below,

Distance: 1.4; 1.5; 1.6 m  
Interference: 1 interference and 2 interference  
Elevation: 0' , 30' and - 45'  
Azimuth : 45, -30, 0, 30, 45  
SIR= 18 dB, 10 dB, 0 dB, -10 dB, -18 dB  
SNR additive noise = 20 dB and 30 dB  

Maybe it takes one week, once or twice measurement.
Looking forward for directions from both of you, and thank you for your advices.

Best,

Dear Sensei,

Thank you for your reply and interest.
1. I will show the result as chart and diagram in thesis book and paper
2. On thesis book and paper, I will show three significant digits only.

Here are my schedules for next two months:  
January 1st week : Writing Thesis  
January 2nd week : Experiment, Writing Thesis and Paper  
January 3rd week : Finalizing Thesis  
January 4th week : Go to Indonesia, Thesis Seminar (open) and Thesis defense (close)  
February 1st week : Thesis revision, Writing paper, Paper submission  
February 2nd week : Fulfill graduation requirements, Paper revision  
February 3rd week : Fulfill graduation requirements, obtain Master Degree certificate if possible  
February 4th week : Conference in Brawijaya University, Back to Japan  

About the conference, I only found the following, SciETec 2012 (Science, Engineering and Technology Seminar 2012) to make presentation
http://www.scietec.ub.ac.id
That is annual seminar for graduate student in Brawijaya University, Malang City (very close to Surabaya, also big University). The paper can be written in English although most of the participants are Indonesian.The deadline is February 7th and the conference will be held on February 23-24, 2012.
I already book the ticket to Surabaya on January 22th (booked by Mrs. Mia when
I planned to go to Japan-vv) but I need support to come back to Japan. If you
allow me to attend that conference, I must leave Japan more than a month (I
plan to directly back to Japan after the conference). Based on my experience
when graduation on bachelor degree, it needs almost a month to fulfill the
graduation requirements. So, the conference date meet my schedule. However, I
need your decision to allow me or not to stay outside Japan more than a month
(in relation to my Jasso scholarship). I plan to back to Japan on February 25th
after attending the conference.

Dear Mr.  Bagus,

Followings inline comments are my comments on your plan.

Ok, then who propose the binaural mask? Is it yours?
If not, still it is OK if nobody check the combination. Just
I want to make clear.

Thus you are not yet confident whether FastICA + Binaural mask works well or not.
In this context, I suggest you check "systematically varied conditions" for
   FastICA
   FastICA + Binaural Mask
as well as
   PDCW
   ICA
   ICA + Binaural Mask

Note that the word "systematically varied" is key.

There is no reason to change the distance if SNR/SIR at source is given in
anechoic chamber.
Using HATS, you need to make an experiment more than 1.5m from the center of
HATS, thus 1.6m is fine as well as 1.5m, but not 1.4m.



> Interference: 1 interference and 2 interference

> Elevation: 0' , 30' and - 45'
Can you setup such a large elevation, +30deg or -45deg in the experimental setup?
Make clear image of realistic setup.

If the hight of HATS is 1.7m for example, ear position will be 1.6m or so.
At 1.5m,  +30deg means 1.5 sin(30deg) + 1.6 = ??? Do you any one who has such
a hight? As well as for -45deg,  1.5 sin(-45deg) + 1.6 = ???  You assume
a baby?


> Azimuth : 45, -30, 0, 30, 45
Why not include ±15, ±60, ±75, ±90

> SIR= 18 dB, 10 dB, 0 dB, -10 dB, -18 dB
Why not 20dB instead of 18dB.
(The previous experimental results is not necessary to use.)

> SNR additive noise = 20 dB and 30 dB
If you will set SNR as Target Signal against ambient noise, those two
seems fine.


> Maybe it takes one week, once or twice measurement.
Before performing experiments, you need to make a computer simulation
through out the condition. Then you can find out necessary conditions
to confirm the feasibility of simulation results.

Please provide the simulation results as soon as possible to cover
the above mentioned condition. Note that if you use HRTF catalog, you
do not pay attention about the distance between sensors and sound source.


Yours,

Dear Sensei,

Here my reply,
1.  No, not from me. I will use binary mask (I am sorry, not binaural mask) proposed by DL Wang et al. and integrating it with fastica. I have checked it, and as long as I know no one propose it.
2.  Ok, I will make "systematically varied" as the key.
3. Thank you, I will use 1.6 m for experiment.
4. I think 30'  and -45' are sound from such as airplane, vacuum cleaner and others. Anyway, I will change to +5, 0 and -5 for elevation. are those ok?
5. So the elevation are, ±90, ± 75, ±60, ±45, ±30, ±15, 0
6. SNR (target vs ambient noise): 20 dB and 30 dB

From DA, he suggest me to use high sampling frequency to reduce spatial aliasing, and also as novelty of this research. Then we can downsampled according to our necessity.

Dear Mr. Bagus,

Pls read
http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/signal/sawada/mypaper/icassp2005sawada.pdf
and his and his colleague's papers.

Also read Prof. Saruwatari's papers on IEEE and IEICE.

Dear Mr. Bagus,

thank you for your reply.
1, 2, 3 would be OK.
About 4, if you assume the noise such as one from vacuum cleaner or airplane,
you need to use such sound. In case of airplane noise, you need think about the
reflection from the ground because airplane noise from +45 in elevation is
assumed to be observed outdoor.

Please make a design of simulation first and get the results of simulation
first. Then you are ready to make experiments on the specific conditions
which you really need to show the differences between the conventional
methods and your combined method.

About the sampling frequency,  Peking University provide 96kHz sample HRTF
database but it is not so popluar in the society. If you use HRTF provided
by Nagoya University, sampling frequency is 48kHz (as far I remember).
Thus, at this moment, I suggest to use 48kHz if you want to use higher
sampling frequency.

If you are going to use two microphone array without head, the characteristics
of directivity of ICA are deeply investigated and there are several interpretation
but the most straight forward interpretation is that ICA provides the automatic
directivity control based on the characteristics of sound environment.
However, there are strong restriction about the number of independent sound
sources and number of independent inputs (number of sensors).

Looking forward to having your simulation plan.

Yours,  
tuie@ TENCON2011 venue in Bali, Indonesia

Dear Sensei,

About elevation, how about a slight different degree because we will use available sound sources such as female, male speech and white noise. So I think its better to make a slight different degree such as +- 10' and 5. If the height of target 1m so the height of interference will be 1.28 cm and 1,13 cm  (for 1.6 m distance).

For sampling frequency, I will 48kHz as you suggested.

About the microphones, I will use microphone in HATS. But I see that our
recorder (Roland R44) has two built in microphones, maybe I can use it as
additional data.

---  
Dear mr. Bagus,

If  you use builtin microphone, can  you  make a simulation before hand? Are you going to messure transfer function of buildin microphone?

Tuie from bali.

---  
Dear sensei,

Thank you for your correction. It is better for me to use microphones on HATS only because HRTFs are available.

---  
From Sensei:  
One comment from me at this moment is that
    please remind the diffraction of head which
    plays  very large roles for ITD and ILD.
(This means that if you use two microphones without
   "object" which provides diffraction, ITD and ILD
   are rather simple and very weak frequency dependency.)

Effect of Over sampling to spatial aliasing
- the microphone space is set to wide and wider with higher sampling frequency
	4 cm	-->	8000 Hz
	8 cm	--> 11025 Hz
	12 cm	-->	22050 Hz
	16 cm	-->	44100 Hz
- proposed method : Subband Adaptive filterbank

Dear sensei,

I put our draft for SciETec 2012 in UB on the following link,

https://www.hicc.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/uploads/private/120128173744/SciETec2012_v1.pdf

Dear Mr. Bagus,

please check the following things before submit the paper
to the committee.

1) Put the reference for PESQ definition.
   (You have referred Ms. Tomita's paper, but you need to
    refer the original PESQ reference as well. Both are necessary.)

2) Significant digit for coherence as well as PESQ, SIR can no be
     4 or more because if you change part of the same data,  numbers
     you have shown would be changed.
    For coherence,  it may be something like 0.89 (two digits before decimal
    point.)
    Also for PESQ,  2 digits are enough and 3 digits are at most like
     1.9 or 1.94
    For SIR in dB,  2 digits below decimal point are at most.
    Most of dB number below 2nd digit below decimal point,  0.01, is not
    significant for actual data processing.
    (If you change the data length such as first half of signal, you may
    have hard time to get the same numbers.)

3) Put the line break before second = in Eq.(6) and Eq.(7).


FYI,  I will be ITS on Thursday & Friday of this week.  
Yours,   
tuie

Dear Sensei,

Thank you for your directions. I will make revision based on your suggestions.

Dear Sensei,

I am very sorry just to inform you my progress now.
My paper in ScieTEc 2012 was rejected due to the following reasons.
Format: not match
Topic: not match
Then, I submit our paper to Basic International Conference 2012 and got the acceptance.

Dear　Mr. Bagus,

thank you for your information.

About ScieTec 2012, it is OK if the committee rejected.
And for Basic 2012, congratulation and please enjoy your
presentation as well as the conference itself at UB.

By the way, the defense for your Master Thesis is successfully
finished?
I hope everything works very well with you.

Yours,
tuie from still cold Kumamoto

PS Yesterday, we have a part for cerebrating the successful
    finish of All Master defense and Bachelor defenses.

Dear Sensei,  

I finished my thesis defense and tomorrow the result will be announced (actually it should be announced on the last week but it was delayed because ITS file server is down). The most exhausting thing is about to fulfill the graduation requirement.
However, I will back to Japan on tuesday 28 and I ask my friend here to process my master degree certificate.

---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,  

thank you for your information. I am grad that you finish your
defense successfully and waiting for the certificate.

Enjoy your conference and Surabaya until you leave.

Dear Sensei,  

I would like to submit my JASSO final report. The current file saved as
https://www.hicc.cs.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/uploads/private/120309141332/Bagus_JASSO.pdf
I am waiting your suggestion for improvement before I submit to the GSST-JASSO.

Yoroshiku onegasishimasu,

---  
I got your progress report and it seems interest to me.
However, in order to write the thesis as well as for the defense,
I suggest the followings.

1) Make graphical representations for the data.

2) Significant digits for coherence and PESQ are correct?
   (If you change the condition little bit, are they still stable
    for all digit?  Do you think that 0.01 difference of PESQ is
    perceptible for human being?)

About the trip back to ITS, please let me know your detail schedule
and when you book the ticket, please let me know.
(If there is any conference/Seminar in Surabaya or near Surabaya, and if
  you can make a presentation, it might be interesting.)

Anyway, have a nice new year holiday in COLD Kumamoto. (I hope you can
survive!)

---  
Dear Mr. Bagus,

thank you for your final report of the JASSO program.
I think it is bit long but it will work, so please
submit it GSST. (In case they said to reduce the number of
pages, I will suggest to you to reduce the research part.)

Anyway, thank you for your work.

Yours,
